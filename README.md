2016/4/8 update:
A program to help me download the weibos from sina by api.
If you want to use this program, you need a map of a region with grid. 
Give the file containing lat and long of the points in the grid.
What's more, another parameters we need is the length of each grid.
I use the PostgreSql to store the data.
If you have a APP_Key and a APP_Secret, you can use it easily.
